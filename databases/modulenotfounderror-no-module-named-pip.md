The error message indicates that the `pip` module is not found in your Python environment. This can happen for several reasons, such as an incomplete or corrupted Python or virtual environment installation.

Here are the steps to resolve the issue:

***

#### 1. **Ensure `pip` is Installed**

Run the following command to ensure `pip` is installed globally in your Python installation:

```bash
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
```

***

#### 2. **Upgrade `pip`**

After ensuring `pip` is installed, upgrade it to the latest version:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

***

#### 3. **Check Your Virtual Environment**

If you are working in a virtual environment, activate it and reinstall `pip` in the environment:

```bash
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

***

#### 4. **Reinstall Virtual Environment**

If the issue persists, your virtual environment may be corrupted. Recreate it:

```bash
deactivate  # Exit the current virtual environment
rm -rf env  # Remove the existing environment (replace `rm -rf` with appropriate command for Windows)
python -m venv env  # Recreate the virtual environment
env\Scripts\activate  # Activate the new environment
python -m pip install --upgrade pip  # Install and upgrade pip
```

***

#### 5. **Verify `pip`**

Once the above steps are complete, verify `pip` is working:

```bash
pip list
```

***

If these steps don't solve the issue, let me know, and we can troubleshoot further!
